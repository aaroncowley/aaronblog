## About the Author/Programmer

My name is Aaron Cowley.  I love everything IT and CS and I love the work I do as a Full Stack Engineer.  There is no greater joy than the feeling of overcoming a challenging problem and seeing the results of your hard work.  Learning how to program has been one of the best decisions of my life and watching my creations come to life is what I want to be doing until I die.  Feel free to browse around the site!
