## Personal Philosophy

I would start by saying that I am not a typical person and that I like to do things the hard way.  There are very few people that appreciate the feeling and benefits one gets from doing something challenging and succeeding.  Granted the "Hard Way", more often than not, takes a greater amount of time.  However, this time is not wasted, unless of course you equate time spent failing to time wasted instead of time learning.  You can miss out on a lot of your true potential if you think any effort that doesnt succeed is wasted.  This toxic mindset fosters complacency and you will watch as others acheive their dreams and you wonder how they got there.

Follow your dreams.  Spend some time failing.
